Example to run :
=================

// https://localhost/index.php/{MODULE_NAME}/{METHOD_NAME}?limit={LIMIT_VALUE}
http://localhost/index.php/user/list?limit=20


If you recall the index.php file, we checked if the $uri[2] variable is set to user. 
Also, the $uri[3] variable value would act as a method name. 
In the above case, the $uri[3] variable is set to list. 

{MODULE_NAME} = $uri[2]  = user

{METHOD_NAME} = $uri[3]  = list

Thus, it would end up calling the listAction method of the UserController class
